![Pagination Starter](link_to_your_image_here)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Pagination Starter project! This is a simple web application that demonstrates pagination of followers' data fetched from an external source. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement the pagination functionality.

## How it Works

The project consists of four JavaScript files:

1. `fetchFollowers.js`: This module fetches the followers' data from an external source asynchronously.

2. `displayFollowers.js`: This module displays the followers' data on the webpage.

3. `paginate.js`: This module handles the pagination of followers' data into multiple pages.

4. `displayButtons.js`: This module dynamically creates and displays navigation buttons for the pages.

The main JavaScript file, `app.js`, ties everything together and controls the pagination behavior based on user interactions.

## Getting Started

To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. The webpage will display a loading message initially.

4. The followers' data will be fetched and paginated automatically once the page finishes loading.
